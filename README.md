<h1>About SketchMap</h1>

<p>SketchMap is a plugin designed to allow players to put images from the web onto a single map or a set of maps. These maps can be added to ItemFrames to complete the image and create awesome visual displays in unmodded minecraft.</p>
<p>SketchMap is currently built using Spigot 1.8, but should run fine on all current 1.8 versions of Bukkit. </p>

<h3>  Creating a new SketchMap</h3>
<ol> 
  <li>Upload your desired image using a online tool like <a href="http://imgur.com>Imgur" target="_blank">Imgur</a> and copy the image URL.</li>
  <li>Now use the command "/sketchmap create <map-name> <URL>" Use Ctrl+V to paste an Image URL</li>
  <li>All done! SketchMap will split your image into 128x128 pixel chunks and give it to you as Maps! You can put these maps onto ItemFrames to show your completed Image!</li>
</ol>
<h3>  Some notes regarding large sketchmaps</h3>
Having a lot of map items (several thousand) in one area can cause serious client-side lag, even on high-end machines. Try to not make incredibly large sketchmaps; 100x100 would be really cool, but if players can't get close enough to see it, is it really worth it?</br>
You should also keep in mind that Minecraft has a hard limit of 32768 map items, so if you create large sketchmaps, you will use up that limit very quickly! (a 50x50 sketchmap uses 2500 map items)
