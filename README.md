<h1>DEPRECATED</h1>
This fork of Sketchmap is deprecated and no longer under active development. It will continue to work with 1.8 and 1.9, and possibly with other versions as well, but there are no guarantees and no bugs will be fixed by me. This is the beauty of Github; if something old is broken, you can fork it and fix the bug yourself, and you'll probably learn more that way anyhow \o/

My replacement plugin (which addresses the server startup time issue, among others) is available at https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/picmap.50826/

<h2>Sketchmap is 100% compatible with 1.8 and 1.9</h2>
Versions before 1.8 are likely to work, but they have not been tested and are not supported.

<h1>About SketchMap</h1>

<p>SketchMap is a plugin designed to allow players to put images from the web onto a single map or a set of maps. These maps can be added to ItemFrames to complete the image and create awesome visual displays in unmodded minecraft.</p>
<p>SketchMap is currently built using Spigot 1.8, but should run fine on all current 1.8 versions of Bukkit. </p>

<h1>Guides:</h1>
<h3>  Creating a new SketchMap</h3>
<ol> 
  <li>Upload your desired image using a online tool like <a href="http://imgur.com>Imgur" target="_blank">Imgur</a> and copy the image URL.</li>
  <li>Now use the command "/sketchmap create" Use Ctrl+V to paste an Image URL</li>
  <li>All done! SketchMap will split your image into 128x128 pixel chunks and give it to you as Maps! You can put these maps onto ItemFrames to show your completed Image!</li>
</ol>
<h3>  Some notes regarding large sketchmaps</h3>
Having a lot of map items (several thousand) in one area can cause serious client-side lag, even on high-end machines. Try to not make incredibly large sketchmaps; 100x100 would be really cool, but if players can't get close enough to see it, is it really worth it?</br>
You should also keep in mind that Minecraft has a hard limit of 32768 map items, so if you create large sketchmaps, you will use up that limit very quickly! (a 50x50 sketchmap uses 2500 map items)
